Sometimes you have to make yourself uncomfortable to follow a dream. That
is what I decided when I took the chance to apply to a new team
here at Nvidia for something I have always wanted to work on... a game engine!

Well technically a simulation engine that's "played" by autonomous agents/hardware, but
same thing.

When I was in college I had the oppertunity to take a couple classes on game engine
design and was incredibly fascinated by what seemed like an extremely intricate
and finely focused piece of software. It was by far my favorite class and one
of the only ones where I read the cover front to back. I never wanted that class to end
and have kept dabling/reading up on state of the art for modern game engine architectures
since then.

When I graduated, there were two things I wanted to do in my career:
	- Work on FOSS for Linux and hopefully contribute to the kernel
	- Work on a game engine

I went the first path the last 5yrs following that dream and have had an incredible time. I love
working on linux networking and FRRouting. They are the software that underpin
the foundation of our internet. To paraphrase my coworker, "if you are streaming
Biggest Loser on Netflix, you are probably touching code we have written."

And I still plan to contribute in my free time!


However, it was time for a change. My mental health and growth as a developer
needed it. I wanted to be uncomfortable again and follow that second dream.

When I saw an opening to work on [Drive-Sim](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/12/nvidia-drive-sim-omniverse-early-access/) here
at Nvidia, I jumped on it. How could I not? The chance fell into my lap right when I needed it.


So Drive-Sim is a simulation engine for training autonomous vehicle agents inside of.
Basically, a game for neural networks to play over & over again to learn as well
as to test hardware like cameras/sensors in a simulated world. I like to describe
it as GTA but only if you could roleplay a person driving around obeying traffic
laws.

I am joining to core runtime team. So the glue that holds all the components
together including the entity component system, time/replay, networking, and
content pipelining.

Needless to say I am pumped.
