I helped chair a workshop on FRR for the linux networking development conference
[Netdev 0x15](https://netdevconf.info/0x15/session.html?FRR-Workshop) this year.

I discussed all the new and fun things that have came to EVPN in FRR: [video](https://youtu.be/_8R1MYP7M48?t=1875)

As mentioned in my previous [post]({{ site.url }}/dev/2021/06/04/GSoC-Lua-Hookpoints.html), 
over the summer I mentored a student implementing a lua scripting subsystem in 
FRR for a GSoC project. Donald presented on his work as well here: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8R1MYP7M48&t=1051s)
